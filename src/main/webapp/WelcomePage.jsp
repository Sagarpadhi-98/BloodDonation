<h1 style="color: red">Welcome to Admin page</h1>
<p>Safe blood saves lives. Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth, children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims and surgical and cancer patients.</p>

<p>There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed.</p>

<p>Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.</p>

<h2 style="color: red">How often can one donate blood?</h2>

<p>The minimum time advised between two donations is 3 months. This gap helps blood regain the normal haemoglobin count.</p>

<h3 style="color: red">Who can donate blood ?</h3>

<p>The age of the donor must be above 18 years and below 65 years of age. He/she must have a haemoglobin count that is not less than 12.5 g/dl. The Weigh should not less than 45 kgs. One should have a normal body temperature at the time of donation.

You should always drink lots of water before the donation. Also, keep in mind that you should take a well-balanced meal prior to and after donating blood. This will keep you healthy and fit.</p>

<p>Transfusion of blood is an essential part of modern health care management. The first Blood Centre was started in India by Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) in 1942 at All India Institute of Hygiene & Public Health, Calcutta (West Bengal).
In 1977, the Blood Centre started operating from the Indian Red Cross Society, National Headquarters (IRCS, NHQ). The Blood Centre is running round the clock and provides the services to the needy patients. It was designated as Regional Blood Centre by State Govt. in 1996 and has been designated as Model Blood Centre in 2010 by National AIDS Control Organization, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt of India and is also certified by the BIS for ISO 9001:2008 and accredited by NABH & NABL.</p>

<p>The NHQ Blood Centre focuses on encouraging voluntary blood donation. It collects approximately 30000 units of blood annually . The percentage of voluntary blood collection is 100% in IRCS and there is 100% component separation of blood units collected. The Blood Centre provides 90% of total collection of blood free of service charges to the patients admitted in the General Ward of Govt. Hospitals in Delhi as well as to around 1000 Thalassaemic patients registered with it.</p>


<p>The IRCS (NHQ) Blood Centre is fully equipped to collect blood at its premises and also has mobile teams, which go out frequently to hold Blood Donation Camps. The blood collected is tested for HIV I & II, HBs Ag, HCV, VDRL & Malaria. Blood grouping with Rh D and Antibodies Testing (three cell panel) is conducted by fully automated advance technology. To ensure effective utilization of blood, besides supplying whole blood, Red Cross also has the facility of component separation that provides different components of blood, like fresh frozen plasma, platelet rich plasma, platelet concentrate, packed cells, cryoprecipitate and platelet aphaeresis.</p>
